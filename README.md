  ## A bit about myself.

🦉Hello! I'm a motivated and curious individual with a strong passion for Python 3. <br>
🌌My knowledge in this area has been built through self-study, extensive reading, online courses, and the invaluable guidance of experienced professionals in the industry. <br>
🌃Currently, I'm furthering my skills through the Harvard CS50P Python course and actively developing a web CRUD translator app. <br>
🌆In the years to come, new projects will be posted and new repositories will be created. Feel free to check them out and contribute.😁 <br>
